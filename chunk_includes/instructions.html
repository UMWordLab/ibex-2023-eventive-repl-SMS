        <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This experiment requires your <b>full attention</b> and must be completed in one session. 
        <b>It is important to read the words carefully</b> - move through the sentences as fast as you can while still understanding the sentence. 
        Trials will timeout after 20 seconds, so you must respond before that time for your data to be recorded.
        There will be a break included every 25 sentences.
        It is common to make occasional mistakes, but participant data that show persistent lack of attention may be rejected.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        In this experiment you will read words from English sentences, one word at a time, and decide whether the new word fits with the previous words of the sentence. A word may not fit because it has a meaning that does not make sense with the beginning of the sentence, or because it would make the sentence ungrammatical. 
        </p>

        <li>The experiment must be completed on a <b>computer</b> with a <b>physical keyboard</b></li>
        <li> During the trials, you should rest your hands on the keyboard with a finger on the <b>F</b> and <b>J</b> keys.</li>
        <li>Press the <b>F</b> if the new word makes sense as a continuation of the sentence, and press the <b>J</b> key if it does NOT when presented with a screen like the following:</li>

        After each sentence, there will be a two second loading period for the next sentence.

        There will be several practice trials to get used to the experiment design before the main experiment begins.
